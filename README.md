Task 1
Create a generalized functional interface. Write a class with one method. In this method, implement the logic:
- if the number 1 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with a string type and pass the logic of reversing the string (outputting the string in reverse order) to the interface method.
- if the number 2 is entered into the console, then: use the interface with an integer type and pass the logic of finding the factorial of the number to the interface method.
